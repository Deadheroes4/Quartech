<font color="white" size="5" face="Tahoma">
We are a team called Quartech that consists of prep, 9th and 10th-grade students at Izmir Bahçeşehir Science and Technology for High School. Our group includes 13 students and a mentor. We are planning to attend a competition called the FTC, short for “FIRST Tech Challenge”. Along with that, we have some other projects in mind. The total skill set of our team is very diverse, so we will be able to do many kinds of other projects. The main purpose of attending the FTC is to help the new generation on STEM and robotics. At the same time, we are excited and feel honored to represent our country, as we are the only active FTC team in Turkey.

<h1><font color="#D975FF"><strong>What Are First and FTC?</strong></font></h1>

<font color="white" size="5" face="Tahoma">
FIRST (For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology) is a non-profit foundation that was founded in 1989 with the intention of spreading the STEM culture among high-schoolers and middle-schoolers. Dean Kamen is the founder of the FIRST foundation; he was born in the USA in 1951. He was a staggeringly important inventor, with many kinds of remarkable inventions.
	Because robotics covers most of the STEM field, the FIRST organization decided to hold a robotics competition. This competition took place in 1992, with 28 different teams as competitors. The inspiring part is that the event took place in a high school gym!
	In 1998, FIRST joined forces with LEGO to put out easier to build robots (These robots were used in the FLL competition, see below). This also allowed FIRST to hold more events. The same year, another event took place with 200 teams.
	More than 400000 teams have been formed; currently there around 38700 teams active with 34000 robots along with them.

	The FIRST Tech Challenge is the one that our team is going to compete in. This competition was designed with 7-12th graders in mind, and will be competed in with robots that can sometimes take months to build.
